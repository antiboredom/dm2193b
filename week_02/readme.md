* Intro to HTML
	* HTML describes the structure of a web page
	* Elements
		* HTML pages are made of elements
		* Elements usually contain **tags**. Usually a start tag and an end tag, and then content in between
		* Elements can be **nested** - elements can live inside of other elements.
		* There are lots of different tags, each for a different category of content.
		* An element might look like this: ```<tagname>content</tagname>```
	* Attributes
		* Attributes give additional information about an element
		* ```<tagname attribute="value">content</tagname>```
	* Some tags require a closing tag, others do not
	* All HTML pages have at least the following elements:
		* ```html```, ```head```, ```title```, ```body```
	* Today we'll look at the following:
		* ```p```, ```ul```, ```li```, ```h1```, ```img```, ```a```, ```strong```, ```div```
	* Remember: HTML gives your page **structure**. You should always try to use the appropriate tag for the content you are including. For example, if you have a big headline on your page, put it in the ```h1``` tag.
	* Indentation & formatting
* Using a text editor
* Intro to FTP
